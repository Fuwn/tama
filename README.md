<a href="https://anilist.co/character/161223" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rxqMH46.png" align="right" height="420vw"></a>

A command-line client for navigating and streaming anime from [Hiruki](https://hiruki.xyz)

Tama allows you to view recent anime trends, search for any anime, and watch any
anime directly on your local system in a trivial manner.

Tama supports any video player and defaults to [`mpv`](https://mpv.io/), but
optionally allows you to open and view anime in your browser instead of a local
video player.

## Usage

You can download the script and run it locally, but I'd recommend fetching and
running it from GitHub to ensure that you are always on the latest version:

```shell
bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuwn/tama/main/tama")
```

> Hint: Alias this in your shell profile: `alias tama="bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuwn/tama/main/tama")"`

### Watch Flow

```shell
# Find an anime to watch
tama s my dress-up darling

# Watch episode 1 using the ID found from the previous search operation
tama w 132405 1
```
