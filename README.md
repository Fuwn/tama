# ðŸ“º `tama`

A command-line client for searching [Hiruki](https://hiruki.xyz)

## Usage

You can download the script and run it locally, but I'd recommend fetching and
running it from GitHub to ensure that you are always on the latest version:

```shell
bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuwn/tama/main/tama")
```

> Hint: Alias this in your shell profile: `alias tama="bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuwn/tama/main/tama")"`

### Watch Flow

```shell
# Find an anime to watch
tama s my dress-up darling

# Watch episode 1 using the ID found from the previous search operation

```
